# starcitizen-launcher
Powershell Script to launch Star Citizen and utilities. It will shutdown programs and services that you don't want running in the background and then turn them back on again afterwards, among other things. It will also launch programs that you want to run while you are playing Star Citizen and then close them (if you want) when the RSI Launcher is closed. 

Download all the files to any directory you would like.

Copy sc-config-example.ps1 to sc-config.ps1 and edit the file to your liking. 

Double click on sc.cmd to launch. If you need to troubleshoot, run the sc.ps1 script manually and watch the output.
